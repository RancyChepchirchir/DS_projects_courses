# DS_projects_courses
This is a repository for interesting projects from online courses related to data science. Text mining, web scraping, data visualization, and geographical analysis
are some of the techniques learned and implemented in these courses. The objective of this repository is to continually modify and improve obsolete forms of manipulating data (Ex. the usage of outdated libraries). In the case of web scraping, adjusts for changes in websites may be necessary.
