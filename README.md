# DS_projects_courses
This is a repository for interesting projects from online courses related to data science and machine learning. Text mining, web scraping, data visualization, and geographical analysis
are some of the techniques learned and implemented related to data science. In the side of machine learning, the standard algorithms are implemented such as SVM, Decision Tree, K-means, KNN, Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression and Hierarchical Clustering. Furthermore, advanced machine learning algorithms are developed for image recognition such as convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and more. The objective of this repository is to continually modify and improve obsolete forms of manipulating data (Ex. the usage of outdated libraries). In the case of web scraping, adjusts for changes in websites may be necessary.
